# PlateCastBar_awesome_wotlk
Nameplate castbar addon modified to show nameplate castbar on all nameplates (even non targeted ones) using awesome_wotlk patch.
Works with every nameplate addon

You can change the position of the nameplate castbar on this part of the code : `CastBar:SetPoint("TOP", namePlate, "BOTTOM", 0, 0)`
Just change the last 0 to the position you want

New update : Rewrite of the code to make it easier to change the castbar with everything else

Now you can set width and height of everything at this line

I added ~120 texture and font files also from Sharedmedia addon, if you want to change the texture skin you can change the name here (same thing for the font)
